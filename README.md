#Pyber Rideshare Analysis

Observations:

With a presence in all three city types of urban, suburban, and rural, Pyber solidifies its hold on the market. Findings to keep in mind as Pyber seeks to strengthen and grow:

Urban cities far exceed suburban and rural cities in number of drivers, total fares, and total rides and are dependent on a high volume of requested rides.

Suburban cities overall strike more balance between total rides and average fares.

Rural cities bring in the highest fares per ride, yet only 6.8% of sum total of fares.

Further analysis is recommended to determine how these facts impact both employees and riders.

Limitations: Length of trips data not included.
